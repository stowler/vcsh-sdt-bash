# from https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/README.md :
# 
#    If ~/.path exists, it will be sourced along with the other files, before any
#    feature testing (such as detecting which version of ls is being used) takes
#    place.
#
# ...so .path is fine place to add paths that don't contain variables, and
# don't differ among hosts.
#
# I use ~/.extra for adding paths that contain varibles but don't differ among hosts.
# I use ~/.extra_local for adding paths that may differ among hosts.
